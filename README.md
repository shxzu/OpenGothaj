# Open Gothaj

**Intellij Ready**

This was already open src but I made it Intellij-ready.

Steps for newgens:

1. Go to your cmd and type "git clone https://github.com/shxzu/OpenGothaj.git".
2. Download Intellij or your favorite IDE.
3. Open the folder resulted from cloning the repo and import the Maven project
4. Run! (If you can even do that smh.)
